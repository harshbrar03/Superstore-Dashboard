# Power BI Dashboards - Sales & Customer Insights

This repository showcases a set of Power BI dashboards created using the **Superstore dataset** from a **USA-based** Superstore, covering data from **2014 to 2017**. The dashboards cover various aspects of sales and business insights. The key dashboards include:

1. **Sales Overview**
2. **Customer Insights**
3. **Profit Overview**
4. **Sales Managers Insights**

Each dashboard includes slicers for selecting data by year (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017) to view data for individual years or all years collectively.

## Contents
- `Superstore.xls`: The dataset used for the dashboards, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).
- `superstore dashboard.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the dashboards.
- `screenshots/`: A folder containing screenshots of the dashboards.

## Requirements
- Power BI Desktop (Free version).
- The dataset (`Superstore.xls`) can also be used in other data analysis tools like Excel, Tableau, etc.

## How to Use
1. **Download the dataset**:  
   - Download the `Superstore.xls` file and save it on your computer.

2. **Open Power BI**:
